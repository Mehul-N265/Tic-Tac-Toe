<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>



This is a game written in javascript where the user clicks on the grid to place his Symbol(In this case 'X') and the computer plays its move. If you don't know how to play ,then search the web and then come back! Eventually I will try to bring two player mode and scoreboard in the future . P.S => I hope you all know to play.
